In the incoming BSC handover procedures, MSC requests BSS to allocate channels to MS. In the intra-BSC handover procedure, BSC itself requests BSS to reallocate radio channels. In the above procedures, if the requested channel type is SDCCH, this item shall be measured after BSC receives a relevant request. Note: SDCCH handover: Handover happens on SDCCH. Channel reallocation: In the immediate assignment procedure, Huawei BSC supports channel reallocation. BSC initiates radio channel allocation when it receives CHANNEL REQUIRED message from BTS. BSC allocates a TCH if the access cause value of CHANNEL REQUIRED is emergency call or call re-establishment and BSC supports very early assignment TCH. Otherwise, BSC allocates a SDCCH. BSC reallocates radio channel automatically based on GSM 0408 if BSC supports very early assignment of TCH and channel allocation fails due to no radio resource available. In other words BSC allocates a TCH automatically if SDCCH allocation fails and the access cause is not location update, and similarly, BSC allocates a SDCCH automatically if TCH allocation fails. So, to one CHANNEL REQUEST message, BSC measures both SDCCH and TCH seizure times. Very early assignment TCH: If BSC allocates a TCH as a signaling channel in immediate assignment procedure, instead of the traffic channel allocation procedure, the Mode Modify procedure can be implemented in the assignment procedure. Assignment SDCCH: In the assignment procedure, MSC sends ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message to BSC to request for a radio channel. BSC responses ASSIGNMENT COMPLETE message to MSC directly if the channel type in the ASSIGNMENT REQUEST is SDCCH. In this case, BSC implements signaling or short message transmission on the channel already allocated. BSC does not measure either attempted SDCCH seizures or successful SDCCH seizures for it does not allocate a new channel. Instead, it measures the times of assignment requests and assignment success after successfully sending ASSIGNMENT COMPLETE message. Discard CHANNLE REQUIRED in internal flow: In the immediate assignment procedure, BSC receives CHANNEL REQUIRED messages from BTS. BSC discards these messages if the system is too busy to respond. In this case, attempted TCH or SDCCH seizures will be measured but successful or unsuccessful channel seizures will not be measured. (BSC32)	1	0		Attempted SDCCH seizures all

After the target cell has allocated channel, activated new channel, and sent Intercell Handover Response to inform the source cell about it. After the source cell sends Handover Command to MS, it enters the state of waiting for the Inter Clear Request message. After the MS has been successfully accessed the new channel, the target cell will send Inter Clear Request to inform the source cell to release the previous channel and this intracell handover is finished successfully. During this period, any abnormality will cause failure of handover. This item measures the times of the unsuccessful intracell handovers in the current cell.

Note: Below are the causes of unsuccessful intracell handover: 1) Previous channel becomes invalid or connection is terminated due to abnormality of radio resource or terrestrial resource; 2) MS fails to access the target channel due to poor radio environment or incorrect handover parameter; 3) Handover is interrupted and original call is cleared because errors have been detected during BSS internal processing; 4) BSS is informed to clear the call when MSC detects error.
